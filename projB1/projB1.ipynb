No late submissions beyond what is outlined in the Slip Day policy will be accepted. We strongly encourage you to plan to submit your work to Gradescope several hours before the stated deadline. This way, you will have ample time to reach out to staff for support if you encounter difficulties with submission. While course staff is happy to help guide you with submitting your assignment ahead of the deadline, we will not respond to last-minute requests for assistance (TAs need to sleep, after all!).\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "You will use what you've learned in class to create a binary classifier that can distinguish spam (junk, commercial, or bulk) emails from ham (regular non-spam) emails. In addition to providing some skeleton code to fill in, we will evaluate your work based on your model's accuracy and your written responses in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this project, you should feel comfortable with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature engineering with text data.\n",
    "- Using the `sklearn` library to process data and fit models.\n",
    "- Validating the performance of your model and minimizing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "This first part of the project focuses on initial analysis, feature engineering, and logistic regression. In the second part of this project (which will be released next week), you will build your own spam/ham classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Content Warning\n",
    "This is a **real-world** dataset —— the emails you are trying to classify are actual spam and legitimate emails. As a result, some of the spam emails may be in poor taste or be considered inappropriate. We think the benefit of working with realistic data outweighs these inappropriate emails but wanted to provide a warning at the beginning of the project so that you are aware.\n",

If the $j$-th word in `words` is present at least once in the $i$-th email in `texts`, the output array should have a value of 1 at the position $(i, j)$. Otherwise, if the $j$-th word is not present in the $i$-th email, the value at $(i, j)$ should be 0.\n",

In future parts of this analysis, we will make use of the data we held out for model validation and comparison.\n",
