# Data200 Homework 1
This repository contains my UC Berkeley Data200 Homework 1 project.

## Overview
In this project, I analyze the relationship between serum cholesterol levels and the presence of heart disease using permutation tests. The analysis explores:
- Hypothesis testing using permutation methods.
- Interpretation of empirical p-values.
- Visualizing distributions of test statistics.
