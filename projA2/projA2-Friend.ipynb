    "In Project A1, you performed some basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), laying out the thought process that leads to certain modeling decisions. Then, you added a few new features to the dataset and cleaned the data in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will specify and fit a linear model to a few features of the housing data to predict house prices. Next, we will analyze the error of the model and brainstorm ways to improve the model's performance. Finally, we'll delve deeper into the implications of predictive modeling within the Cook County Assessor's Office (CCAO) case study, especially because statistical modeling is how the CCAO valuates properties. Given the history of racial discrimination in housing policy and property taxation in Cook County, consider the impacts of your modeling results as you work through this project, and think about what fairness might mean to property owners in Cook County.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this part of the project, you should be comfortable with:\n",
    "- Implementing a data processing pipeline using `pandas`.\n",
    "- Using `scikit-learn` to build and fit linear models.\n",

    "B: Less unfair than other scenarios. Although the homewoner may not be able to sell the house at its satisfactory price, the homeowner benefits by paying lower taxes when still holding the property right. This scenario doesn’t cause direct financial harm to the homeowner unless they are actively trying to sell the house. \n",
    "\n",
    "C: This is particularly unfair because it disproportionately affects low-income households. Inexpensive homes are often owned by lower-income families, and overvaluing these homes means these households pay more in taxes than they should. Meanwhile, undervaluing expensive properties benefits wealthier homeowners, allowing them to pay less in taxes. This exacerbates social and economic inequality.\n",
    "\n",
    "D: This is relatively unfair. While wealthy homeowners might end up paying more taxes in this scenario, lower-income families benefit because their less expensive homes are undervalued, leading to lower tax payments. This could result in a more progressive tax distribution, making it somewhat fairer than option C."

This government institution determines property taxes across most of Chicago's metropolitan areas and nearby suburbs. In the United States, all property owners must pay property taxes, which are then used to fund public services, including education, road maintenance, and sanitation. These property tax assessments are based on property values estimated using statistical models considering multiple factors, such as real estate value and construction cost.\n",

Wealthy homeowners, who were typically white, paid less in property taxes, whereas [working-class, non-white homeowners paid more](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-cook-county-assessor-berrios-sued-met-20171214-story.html).\n",

After \"compiling and analyzing more than 100 million property tax records from the years 2003 through 2015, along with thousands of pages of documents, then vetting the findings with top experts in the field,\" they discovered that \"residential assessments had been so far off the mark for so many years.\" You can read more about their investigation [here](https://apps.chicagotribune.com/news/watchdog/cook-county-property-tax-divide/assessments.html).\n",

The autograder will have more than 4GB of memory, so you will not lose credit as long as your solution to Question 5 is within the total memory (4GB) limits of Datahub. By default, we reset the memory and clear all variables using `%reset -f`. If you want to delete specific variables, you may also use `del` in place of `%reset -f%`. For example, the following code will free up memory from data used for older models: `del training_val_data, test_data, train, validation, X_train_m1, X_valid_m1, X_train_m2, X_valid_m1`. Our staff solution can be run independently from all other questions, so we encourage you to do the same to make debugging easier.\n",

We will delog/exponentiate your prediction on Gradescope to compute RMSE and use this to score your model. Before submitting to Gradescope, make sure that your predicted values can all be delogged (i.e., if one of your `Log Sale Price` predictions is 60, it is too large; $e^{60}$ is too big!)\n",

    "Just as in the guided model from the previous question, you should encapsulate as much of your workflow into functions as possible. Your job is to select better features and define your own feature engineering pipeline inside the function `feature_engine_final` in the following cell. Use of `.pipe` is not required, but you are welcome to incorporate it! **You must not change the parameters inside `feature_engine_final`. Do not edit the two lines at the end of the question cell below. They are helper functions that define a linear model, fit your data, and compute RMSE. If you do, you will receive no credit for this question.** \n",

    "- All other feature engineering techniques should be applied to both the training and test sets. This means that you should perform them under the condition `else:`.\n",
    "- When `is_test_set` is `True`, your function should return only the design matrix, `X`.\n",
    "- When `is_test_set` is `False`, your function should return both the design matrix and the response variable `Y` (the `Log Sale Price` column).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "-  Some features may have missing values in the test set but not in the training/validation set. Make sure `feature_engine_final` handles missing values appropriately for each feature.\n",
    "- We have imported all feature engineering functions from Project A1 for you. You do not have access to the `feature_func.py` file with the function body and definitions, but they work as defined in Project A1. Feel free to use them as you see fit!\n",
    "- You may wish to consider removing outlying datapoints from the training set before fitting your model. You may not, however, remove any datapoints from the test set (after all, the CCAO could not simply \"refuse\" to make predictions for a particular house!)\n",
    "- As you finetune your model, you may unintentionally consume too much Datahub memory, causing your kernel to crash. See `q5a` for guidance on how to resolve this!!\n",

You will be predicting `Log Sale Price` on the data stored in `cook_county_contest_test.csv`. To determine your model's RMSE on the test set, you will submit the predictions made by your model to Gradescope. There, we will run checks to see what your test RMSE is by considering (hidden) true values for the `Sale Price`. We will delog/exponentiate your prediction on Gradescope to compute RMSE and use this to score your model. Before submitting to Gradescope, make sure that your predicted values can all be delogged (i.e., if one of your `Log Sale Price` predictions is 60, it is too large; $e^{60}$ is too big!)\n",

    "The residual represents the difference between the actual sale price and the model's predicted value. The residual values impact property taxes because the property tax is based on the estimation of house price, and they determine if a homeownner will pay more tax than he/she should. \n",
    "\n",
    "A positive residual, where the model underestimates the actual price, benefits the homeowner by potentially lowering their property taxes. Conversely, a negative residual, where the model overestimates the sale price, results in higher taxes, which can place an additional financial burden on the homeowner, especially if they cannot afford the inflated tax based on the overestimated value. This discrepancy is particularly concerning in lower-income areas, where overvaluation can lead to regressive tax effects, disproportionately impacting those with limited financial resources."

    "\n",
    "In the case of the Cook County Assessor’s Office, Chief Data Officer Rob Ross states that fair property tax rates are contingent on whether property values are assessed accurately —— that they’re valued at what they’re worth, relative to properties with similar characteristics. This implies that having a more accurate model results in fairer assessments. The goal of the property assessment process for the CCAO, then, is to be as accurate as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "When the use of algorithms and statistical modeling has real-world consequences, we often refer to the idea of fairness as a measurement of how socially responsible our work is. Fairness is incredibly multifaceted: Is a fair model one that minimizes loss - one that generates accurate results? Is it one that utilizes \"unbiased\" data? Or is fairness a broader goal that takes historical contexts into account?\n",
    "\n",
    "These approaches to fairness are not mutually exclusive. If we look beyond error functions and technical measures of accuracy, we'd not only consider _individual_ cases of fairness but also what fairness —— and justice —— means to marginalized communities on a broader scale. We'd ask: What does it mean when homes in predominantly Black and Hispanic communities in Cook County are consistently overvalued, resulting in proportionally higher property taxes? When the white neighborhoods in Cook County are consistently undervalued, resulting in proportionally lower property taxes? \n",
    "\n",
    "Having \"accurate\" predictions doesn't necessarily address larger historical trends and inequities, and fairness in property assessments in taxes works beyond the CCAO's valuation model. Disassociating accurate predictions from a fair system is vital to approaching justice at multiple levels. Take Evanston, IL —— a suburb in Cook County —— as an example of housing equity beyond just improving a property valuation model: their City Council members [recently approved reparations for African American residents](https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2021-03-23/chicago-suburb-approves-government-reparations-for-black-residents).\n"

    "RMSE quantifies the average error in predictions, providing a measure of accuracy in terms of how closely the model’s outputs match actual values. A low RMSE generally indicates that the model’s predictions are accurate on average across the entire dataset. However, this measure alone does not guarantee fairness. Fairness requires that the model's errors are equitably distributed across different groups. A model with a low RMSE may be statistically accurate but could still be \"unfair\" if it consistently overvalues properties in marginalized communities and undervalues those in affluent ones, resulting in disproportionate tax burdens.\n",
    "\n",
    "**what makes a model's predictions of property values for tax assessment purposes \"fair\"?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A model's predictions for property values are \"fair\" if they spread errors evenly across all groups, avoid hurting any specific community more than others, and match real market values in all neighborhoods.  Given the history of housing discrimination in areas like Cook County, a fair model should account for historical inequities that might be reflected in the data. For instance, ensuring that predominantly Black and Hispanic neighborhoods are not systematically overvalued as they have been in the past could help mitigate the effects of historical bias. Fairness also involves creating a transparent model. Homeowners should be able to know why their property was assessed at a certain value.\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure fairness, we can check if errors are similar for different groups (Group RMSE), see if there’s a balance in overvaluation and undervaluation across neighborhoods, and compare assessed values to actual sale prices. These checks help ensure the model is not only accurate but also fair to everyone. Also, to ensure transparency, CCAO can release the features included in estimating house value to the public. "

Once you submit this file to the Project A2 Coding assignment on Gradescope, Gradescope will automatically submit a PDF file with your written answers to the Project A2 Written assignment. If you run into any issues when running this cell, feel free to check this [section](https://ds100.org/debugging-guide/autograder_gradescope/autograder_gradescope.html#why-does-grader.exportrun_teststrue-fail-if-all-previous-tests-passed) in the Data 100 Debugging Guide.\n",

    "If there are issues with automatically generating the PDF, you can try downloading the notebook as a PDF by clicking on `File -> Save and Export Notebook As... -> PDF`. If that doesn't work either, you can manually take screenshots of your answers to the manually graded questions and submit those. \n",

    "* **Project A2 Coding:** Submit the zip file generated by using the `grader.export()` cell provided below.\n",
    "* **Project A2 Written:** Gradescope will automatically submit the PDF from the zip file submitted earlier. You do not need to submit anything to this assignment yourself, but *please check that the submission went through properly and that all plots rendered correctly*.\n",
    "* **Project A2 Test Set Predictions:** Submit the CSV file generated in `q5f`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You are responsible for ensuring your submission follows our requirements and that everything was generated and submitted correctly. We will not be granting regrade requests nor extensions to submissions that don't follow instructions.** If you encounter any difficulties with submission, please don't hesitate to reach out to staff prior to the deadline.
